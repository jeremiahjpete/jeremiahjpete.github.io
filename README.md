# Portfolio Website
This React app is being built in order to display the projects I've done throughout the years, including both programming and artistsic. Initially this came about as a way to properly have timelapse videos of all my videos available beyond just my phone for people to view, but as I thought about it more I figured I'd create a website that shows off all of my talents!

The template layout is from [this repository](https://github.com/mykyta111/react-portfolio?ref=reactjsexample.com), with enough changes to create my own take and style stemming from it.

## Home
The Home section contains paths to the rest of the site, as well as external links to my socials and gaming accounts

## Portfolio
I have example images of some of my art (as well as the time lapses that go with them) to display as what I've been able to create through the years to potential clients (or people who just want to view my art).

## Misc.
I also have 'About', 'Contact', and 'Prices' sections that are fully functioning
