# My Portfolio Website
This React app is being built in order to display the projects I've done throughout the years, including both programming and artistsic. Initially this came about as a way to properly have timelapse videos of all my videos available beyond just my phone for people to view, but as I thought about it more I figured I'd create a website that shows off all of my talents!

As of now, the project is in an infancy stage, and the outline of how it will be structured has just been finished and this will be updated as more progress is made.
